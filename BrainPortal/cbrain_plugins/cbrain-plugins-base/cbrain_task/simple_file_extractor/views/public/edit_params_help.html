<h3>SimpleFileExtractor</h3>

This program will extract files out of a set of FileCollections.
The result is a new FileCollection which will be a flat set of all
the extracted files.

<p>

Files are specified using standard UNIX file 'patterns' (or globs).
These are <em>not</em> regular expressions.

<p>

File patterns may contain:
<p>

<dl>
  <dt>*</dt>

  <dd>
    An asterix will match zero, one, or many characters in a filename
    or in a path component. It will not match the directory separator "/".
  </dd>

  <dt>?</dt>

  <dd>
    A question mark will match a single character in a filename or
    in a path component.
  </dd>
</dl>

<p>

File patterns will be matched with all the files in all
the selected FileCollections in input, and files that are matched
will be extracted and copied into the output FileCollection,
as a flat list (no subdirectories will be created in it).

<p>

All file patterns must include a first component that will be matched
with the base name of the FileCollection itself. That means a pattern
will always include at least on "/" character in it. This can be used
to write patterns that will match only a subset of the input FileCollections.

<p>

This program will <strong>not</strong> extract:

<ul>
  <li>Subdirectories</li>
  <li>Symbolic links</li>
  <li>Other types of special files</li>
</ul>

For performance reasons, the program will ensure that at execution
time, the set of files given in input are located on a DataProvider
that is configured as <em>local</em> storage, to avoid having to
copy the entire file collection contents before extraction.

<h3>Examples</h3>

Assume we have selected three FileCollections named "Dataset1",
"CivetOut2" and "BIDS3", and that they contain these files:

<p>

Content of all three collections:<br>
<pre>
Dataset1/README.txt
Dataset1/sales/sales.csv
Dataset1/sales/sales.txt
Dataset1/reports/errors.txt
Dataset1/reports/errors.pdf
CivetOut2/native/subject.mnc.gz
CivetOut2/thickness/thick_subject_30mm.txt
CivetOut2/thickness/thick_subject_40mm.txt
CivetOut2/surfaces/surf_subject_30mm.txt
CivetOut2/surfaces/surf_subject_40mm.txt
BIDS3/Report.txt
BIDS3/sub-1234/README.txt
BIDS3/sub-1234/anat/sub-1234.nii.gz
</pre>

<p>
The following patterns will each extract these files:
<p>
Pattern: <kbd>*D*/R*.txt</kbd><br>
Files matched: <samp>Dataset1/README.txt, BIDS3/Report.txt</samp><br>
Resulting files in output: <samp>README.txt, report.txt</samp>
<p>
Pattern: <kbd>*/s*/*.txt</kbd><br>
Files matched: <samp>Dataset1/sales/sales.txt, CivetOut2/surfaces/surf_subject_30mm.txt, CivetOut2/surfaces/surf_subject_40mm.txt, BIDS3/sub-1234/README.txt</samp><br>
Resulting files in output: <samp>sales.txt, surf_subject_30mm.txt, surf_subject_40mm.txt, README.txt</samp>
<p>
Pattern: <kbd>*/*/*30mm*</kbd><br>
Files matched: <samp>CivetOut2/thickness/thick_subject_30mm.txt, CivetOut2/surfaces/surf_subject_30mm.txt</samp><br>
Extracted files: <samp>thick_subject_30mm.txt, surf_subject_30mm.txt</samp>
