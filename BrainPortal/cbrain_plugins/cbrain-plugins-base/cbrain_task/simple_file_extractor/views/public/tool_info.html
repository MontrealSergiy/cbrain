<h1>SimpleFileExtractor</h1>

This tool can extract arbitrary files from FileCollections
(or other FileCollection subclasses) based on standard UNIX
file patterns (filenames with '*' and '?' in them).
<p>
The tool will produce a new simple FileCollection containing all the
extracted files in a single level (basically, a directory with all
those files).
<p>
See the help page for the parameters for more information and recommendations
about how the patterns must be specified, and what kind of error handling
the tool provides.
<p>

<small>
This tool comes standard as part of the CBRAIN distribution.
